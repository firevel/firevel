## About Firevel

Firevel is a modified, serverless version of [Laravel 10](https://laravel.com/) designed to work inside Google App Engine PHP 8.2 standard environment, together with [Google Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/) as database and cache.

In addition to standard [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/) benefits it offers:

- Simple, serverless setup.
- Downscaling to zero.
- Micro-service friendly design.
- [Free tier eligibility](https://cloud.google.com/free/).
- Capacity to deal with high loads.

## Requirements

- [Laravel Server Requirements](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/installation#server-requirements)
- [gRPC extension](https://cloud.google.com/php/grpc)
- [gcloud command-line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts)

## Before you start

- Make sure you `gcloud` is initialized using `gcloud init` command.
- Make sure you created project at [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/project) and set it on your console using `gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID`.
- Login to [Google Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) find [Firesore section](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore) and make sure that your project is running on [Native mode](`https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/firestore-or-datastore`). If your project is already using Datastore mode you might need to create a new project.

## Installation

1) Create a project in the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/project).

2) [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts) and initialize (`gcloud init`) [gcloud command-line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud).

3) Create firevel project with:
```
composer create-project firevel/firevel
```

4) Deploy project with:
```
gcloud app deploy
```

Firevel does not require any credentials while running inside App Engine. If you like to run it locally you will also need to set `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` and `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` .env variables. If you prefer to use `git clone https://github.com/firevel/firevel.git`, you should also run `php artisan firevel:generate:app` to generate your `app.yaml` file. You might also need to enable App Engine Admin API.

## Local development

To setup local environment you can use `docker-compose.yml`:
```
version: '3'

volumes:
  firestore-data:

services:
  firestore:
    image: pathmotion/firestore-emulator-docker
    volumes:
      - firestore-data:/opt/data
    environment:
      - FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID=${DB_DATABASE}
  app:
    image: firevel/firevel:php73
    volumes:
      - ./:/var/www/app
```

## Differences between [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and Firevel.

Firevel is a Laravel 10 after [small updates](https://github.com/firevel/firevel/commits/master) and packages installation:
- [Firestore Session driver](https://github.com/firevel/firestore-session-driver)
- [Firestore Cache driver](https://github.com/firevel/firestore-cache-driver)
- [Stack driver log channel](https://github.com/firevel/stackdriver-log-channel)
- [Laravel Firestore wrapper](https://github.com/firevel/firestore)

## Usage

You can use Firevel in the same way you use Laravel. Be aware of [Firebase limits](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quotas) and [Google App Engine limits](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/php7/runtime).

## File Storage
By default Firevel running inside App Engine is using [Google Cloud Storage file system](https://github.com/Superbalist/laravel-google-cloud-storage), and  `{GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.appspot.com/services/{GAE_SERVICE}/storage/` path.

## CI

You can run a simple CI process with `gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml --substitutions _APP_KEY=` with your production API key at the end. You can also [connect it with your existing repository](https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories/docs/quickstart-triggering-builds-with-source-repositories) but remember about setting `_APP_KEY` in substitution variables.

You also must [grant App Engine access to the Cloud Build service account](https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories/docs/quickstart-triggering-builds-with-source-repositories#grant_access_to_the_service_account).

## Workers

If you are going to use serverless workers, install https://github.com/firevel/cloud-tasks-queue-driver.

## Roadmap
- Laravel 10 base.
- CI generator as separate package.
- Improved MySQL handling (socket connections + passwordless authentication).
- File cache.
