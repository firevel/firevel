## About Firevel

Firevel is a modified, serverless version of [Laravel 12](https://laravel.com/) designed to work inside Google App Engine PHP 8.4 standard environment, together with [Google Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/) as database and cache.

In addition to standard [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/) benefits it offers:

- Simple, serverless setup.
- Downscaling to zero.
- Micro-service friendly design.
- [Free tier eligibility](https://cloud.google.com/free/).
- Capacity to deal with high loads.

## Requirements

- [Laravel Server Requirements](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/deployment#server-requirements)
- [gRPC extension](https://cloud.google.com/php/grpc)
- [gcloud command-line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts)

## Before you start

- Make sure you `gcloud` is initialized using `gcloud init` command.
- Make sure you created project at [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/project) and set it on your console using `gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID`.
- Login to [Google Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) find [Firesore section](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore) and make sure that your project is running on [Native mode](`https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/firestore-or-datastore`). If your project is already using Datastore mode you might need to create a new project.

## Installation

1) Create a project in the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)

2) [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts) and initialize (`gcloud init`) [gcloud command-line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud)

3) Create firevel project with `composer create-project firevel/firevel`

4) Generate your `app.yaml` file using `php artisan firevel:generate app.yaml`

4) Deploy project with `gcloud beta app deploy`

Firevel does not require any credentials while running inside App Engine. If you like to run it locally you will also need to set `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` and `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` .env variables. You might also need to enable App Engine Admin API.

## Local Development with Docker and Buildpacks

### Building the Image

To replicate the production environment for local development, you can utilize Buildpacks. Use the [pack](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/) command with specific environment variables:

```bash
pack build your_image_name --env=GOOGLE_COMPOSER_ARGS=--dev --builder=gcr.io/buildpacks/builder:v1
```

Once the image is built, it can be integrated with Docker, typically through a `docker-compose.yaml` file.

### Configuration

You can configure PHP extensions for development mode using the `php.local.ini` file. This allows for customized behavior during local development.

### Accessing the Container Environment

To execute PHP commands within the container, use the `/cnb/lifecycle/launcher`. For instance:

```bash
/cnb/lifecycle/launcher php route:list
```

For those looking to utilize Composer within the container, it comes pre-installed. Access it with:

```bash
/cnb/lifecycle/launcher php vendor/bin/composer
```

### Laravel Tinker

To run Laravel Tinker, execute the following command:

```bash
/cnb/lifecycle/launcher php artisan tinker
```

For MacBook users, ensure the `TERM` variable is set correctly. As an example:

```bash
docker exec -e TERM=$TERM -it your_container_name /cnb/lifecycle/launcher php artisan tinker
```


## Differences between [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and Firevel.

Firevel is a Laravel 12 after small updates and packages installation:
- [Firestore Session driver](https://github.com/firevel/firestore-session-driver)
- [Firestore Cache driver](https://github.com/firevel/firestore-cache-driver)
- [Laravel Firestore wrapper](https://github.com/firevel/firestore)

## Usage

You can use Firevel in the same way you use Laravel. Be aware of [Firebase limits](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quotas) and [Google App Engine limits](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/php7/runtime).

### File Storage
By default Firevel running inside App Engine is using [Google Cloud Storage file system](https://github.com/Superbalist/laravel-google-cloud-storage), and  `{GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.appspot.com/services/{GAE_SERVICE}/storage/` path.


### Logging

If you are using `app.yaml` generated by `firevel:generate app` your logs going to be stored in Stackdriver.


### Artisan

To run artisan commands inside serverless containers, install https://github.com/firevel/artisan.

### Workers

If you are going to use serverless workers, install https://github.com/firevel/cloud-tasks-queue-driver.

## Roadmap
- CI generator as separate package.
- Improved MySQL handling (socket connections + passwordless authentication).
